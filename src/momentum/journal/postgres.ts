// The journal in Postgres — one row per trade, which is what makes two machines share a record.
//
// WHY A ROW PER TRADE rather than the month document the file store keeps. A document has to be
// read, modified and written back, which raises the question of whose copy is newer every time two
// machines touch it — and answering that question needs a revision counter and the code to
// arbitrate it. A row keyed on the trade's own id needs none of that: `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (id)
// DO UPDATE` is the whole of it, and a bad write can damage one trade instead of a month.
//
// WHY JSONB AND NOT COLUMNS. The trade carries about thirty fields and will carry more. Promoting
// every one of them into a column means a migration each time the record learns something, and
// this is a personal trade log rather than a warehouse. So the whole record is JSONB and only the
// handful worth querying or summing — day, channel, symbol, the two money figures, the two flags —
// are promoted out and indexed. `schema.sql` in this module already anticipated the trade-off; it
// said `momentum_history` is "the one table that genuinely wants a database", and this is the same
// argument for the same reason.
//
// SERVERLESS COMPUTE SLEEPS. Neon suspends an idle branch and wakes it on the next connection,
// which shows up as a cold first query and, less obviously, as a pooled connection that was killed
// while nothing was using it. So the pool is small, its idle timeout is short, and every statement
// gets exactly one retry on the error classes that mean "the socket went away" rather than "your
// SQL is wrong". Retrying a syntax error forever is how a scanner spends an afternoon failing.
