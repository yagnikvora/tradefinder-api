// The cron jobs. Three of them, and the intervals are a rate-limit budget, not a taste.
//
//   SCAN        every `refresh.quoteMs` (default 15s), while the market is open.
//               Three quote requests plus up to `shortlistSize` chain requests, which the
//               enrichment cache collapses to roughly one chain pass per `refresh.enrichMs`.
//               The interval is 15s rather than 30s because the timing layer's resolution
//               IS the poll interval: a trigger cannot be reported sooner than the reading
//               that would have detected it. The chain tier is unaffected — its own TTL
//               still collapses enrichment to once a minute.
//
//   BASELINE    once a day at `refresh.baselineHourIst` (default 08:00 IST), before the
//               open. ~416 requests. Also runs on boot if the stored baseline is not
//               today's, because a scanner with no volume profile has no RVOL, which is the
//               heaviest factor in the model.
//
//   SEED        once per process per day, after the baseline. ~208 requests, and only for
//               symbols this process did not watch from the open — so a scanner that has been
//               up since 09:10 spends nothing, and one started at 13:00 (or at 21:00) rebuilds
//               the part of the session it missed from the exchange's own candles rather than
//               reporting the whole board as "warming up". See data/session-seed.ts.
//
//   FLUSH       the session state, on a slow tick, so a crash costs seconds of VWAP slope
//               rather than the morning's opening ranges.
//
// Scanning stops when the market closes. The numbers are frozen for the day, so continuing
// to poll would spend the request budget re-fetching a board that cannot change — and the
// first scan after the open needs that budget intact. One scan IS run after the close, so
// the final board of the day is the settled one and the IV history record is the close.
